1. INPUT/OUTPUT

    A. DORMANCY : last interaction (diff to last input or output)
    B. AGE : diff to first input
    C. TOXICITY : diff to last output
    D. UTXO : number of unspent transaction outputs

2. PRICES API
    * check and overwrite when populating (no duplications)
    * fetch prices older than 2013-03-01
    * indicators : DMAs

3. Sort out remaining 35000 addresses (pull addresses from addresses.txt to the DB)

4. Process incoming blocks

5. Time of day
    * e.g. for bottom (depending on draw-down %, bounce from bottom)

Systems
=================================================================================
1. Testing
       * Automated tests for existing APIs
           + run at each build
       * Unit tests
           + cover all relevant scenarios

2. Refactorings
    * code cleanup, remove dead code, restructure code

3. Logging

4. DCA
       * from (mandatory)
       * to (optional, by default until present day)
       * buyspan (in days)
       * $ amount
       * timespan (e.g. 1 year after, by default until present day)
       * result
           + final amount
           + P/L
           + ROI

5. safeguard APIs for correct data types (e.g. for dates only valid ones are allowed i.e. no exceptions are thrown)
