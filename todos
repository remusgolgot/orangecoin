April backlog
=============

1. Unit Tests
    - AddressService
        -> addressFull
    - PriceService
        -> priceStats

2. Automated Tests
    - Cover APIs

3. Sync up to Block 210K (1st epoch)

4. Logging
==========================

1. APIS
    * replace long timestamps with String in the API responses (simple address, full address, other address APIs)
    * define TOXICITY (score, some combination of number of utxos, size, age, number of utxos spent)

/prices
    * fetch prices older than 2013-03-01
    * check and overwrite when populating (no duplications)
    * possibly use scraping, since public APIs are unreliable, and cannot handle (for free) dates way in the past

/systems
    * easier way to put win/loss (now we have to compare min/max to 0.00)
    * interval of changes
        -> e.g. : [-5,0,1,3,2,7,1,3]
        -> e.g. : [-4,null,-4,null,null,7]
        -> this mode ignores all other inputs, besides: from,to,target
    * combine calls/systems
        -> e.g. 3 day losing streak AND [..]

/indicators
    * DMA

2. Export

3. Process incoming blocks
    - sync with current blocks

4. DCA Calculator
             * from (mandatory)
             * to (optional, by default until present day)
             * buyspan (daily / weekly / other time periodicity)
             * $ amount per buy
             * timespan (optional, e.g. 1 year after the last buy, by default until present day)
             * result
                 + final amount invested
                 + final value
                 + P/L
                 + ROI

5. Automated tests
    * run at each build

6. Unit tests
    + price controllers unit tests
    + address controllers unit tests

7. Refactorings
       * code cleanup, remove dead code, restructure code
       * safeguard APIs for correct data types (e.g. for dates only valid ones are allowed i.e. no exceptions are thrown)

8. Documentation
