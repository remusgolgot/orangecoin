1. INPUT/OUTPUT

    A. DORMANCY : last interaction (diff to last input or output)
    B. AGE : diff to first input
    C. TOXICITY : diff to last output
    D. UTXO : number of unspent transaction outputs

2. PRICES API
    * check and overwrite when populating (no duplications)
    * fetch prices older than 2013-03-01
    * indicators : DMAs

3. Sort out remaining 35000 addresses (pull addresses from addresses.txt to the DB)

4. Process incoming blocks

5. Systems API
    * interval of changes
        -> e.g. : [-5,0,1,3,2,7,1,3]
        -> e.g. : [-4,null,-4,null,null,7]
        -> this mode ignores all other inputs, besides from,to,target

6. DCA Calculator
             * from (mandatory)
             * to (optional, by default until present day)
             * buyspan (in days)
             * $ amount
             * timespan (e.g. 1 year after, by default until present day)
             * result
                 + final amount
                 + P/L
                 + ROI

7. Automated tests
    * run at each build

8. Unit tests
    + price controllers unit tests
    + address controllers unit tests

9. Refactorings
       * code cleanup, remove dead code, restructure code
       * safeguard APIs for correct data types (e.g. for dates only valid ones are allowed i.e. no exceptions are thrown)

10. Logging
